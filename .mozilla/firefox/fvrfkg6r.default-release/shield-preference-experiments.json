With these experiments, we aim to increase our ability to target an experiment to that population accurately.  This will involve 3 experiments all setting a dummy pref - so there will be no changes to the user. The experiment will just enroll users into a branch and then we'll evaluate through existing telemetry if those users truly are \"new users\" after the fact.","enrollmentId":"1d03fc96-9b08-4ac9-9a54-eb31b1d7b070"}}}
